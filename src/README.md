## How to compile [Linux]

Open a terminal in this folder directory and execute the following command:


```bash
./Run.sh
```

## Symmetric/oblivious mode set

1. It will run the script and will automatically popup a new terminal where you can define if you want to generate symmetric or oblivious keys (To set the mode, set the input parameter "keyType" to 0 (oblivious keys) or 1 (symmetric keys) directly in the terminal).
2. Finally it will compile the files and open both outputs.
